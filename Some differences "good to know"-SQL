Some differences are "Good to Know"
1) HAVING vs WHERE Clause:
WHERE Clause:
Used with the SELECT statement to filter rows before grouping or aggregating.
Applies conditions to individual rows before they are grouped or aggregated.
Commonly used for filtering on non-aggregated columns.

SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1;
HAVING Clause:
Used with the GROUP BY statement to filter rows after grouping or aggregating.
Applies conditions to aggregated values, often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG.
Commonly used for filtering on aggregated results.

SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

2) Joins vs UNION / UNION ALL:
Joins:
Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
Different types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
Joins are used to retrieve columns from multiple tables in a single result set.

SELECT *
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
UNION / UNION ALL:
Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.
UNION removes duplicate rows, while UNION ALL includes all rows, even duplicates.
The number and order of columns must be the same in all SELECT statements.

SELECT column1 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1 FROM table2;

3) MERGE vs UNION ALL / UNION:
MERGE
Used to perform insert, update, or delete operations based on a specified condition.
Commonly used for upsert operations (insert if not exists, else update).
Requires the target table to be specified and involves more complex syntax.

MERGE INTO target_table
USING source_table
ON condition
WHEN MATCHED THEN
 UPDATE SET column1 = value1
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
 INSERT (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
UNION / UNION ALL:
Combines rows from two or more SELECT statements.
Does not involve updates or deletes; it's purely for combining results.
Simpler syntax compared to MERGE.

4) INTERSECT, MERGE, UNION, UNION ALL, JOIN:
INTERSECT :
Returns only the common rows between two SELECT statements.
Requires that the number and order of columns in the SELECT statements be the same.

SELECT column1 FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1 FROM table2;
MERGE :
Performs insert, update, or delete operations based on a condition.
Involves modifying data in the target table based on the source table.

UNION/ UNION ALL :
Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.
UNION removes duplicates, while UNION ALL includes all rows.

JOIN:
Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
Different types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
Used to retrieve columns from multiple tables in a single result set.
